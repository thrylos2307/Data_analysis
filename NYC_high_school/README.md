# NYC High school

One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the effectiveness of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups or not. We will examine this in connection with the SAT.

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points. Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more to see if standardized tests are unfair to certain groups or not.
